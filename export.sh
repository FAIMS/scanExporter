**Click \"Download file\" below to get your data as a single compressed file.**

The data will be in .tar.bz2 format to allow large-file export which can be unpacked via programs like [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) on windows or tar on linux. You may need to unpack the tarball after decompressing the bz2 outer container: in plain langauge, unpack it twice. This is normal and everything is fine.

If you see 'Segmentation Fault' in the text below, retry the export.
